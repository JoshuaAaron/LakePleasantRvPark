      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>Lake Pleasant RV Park is a family-owned and operated RV Park for over 30 years.
        With commitment to quality and excellence, it is our mission to provide a safe,
        beautiful and well-maintained property for our long-term residents, seasonal
        visitors and short-term guests. It is our duty to provide unparalleled customer
        service combined with the finest offering of RV resorts, amenities, and activities
        for you and your family to enjoy the great outdoors of western Washington.</p>
      <p>Our lovely park includes a wildlife habitat and small lake filled with fish and waterfowl.
        All sites are within a short walking distance to the small lake and many are waterfront.
        Watch the ducks and cranes, listen to the bullfrogs and enjoy our lawns and trees.
        We're the perfect spot to jump off to wine tasting and dining in Woodinville or exploring
        Seattle attractions and museums. We have wooded nature trails, a putting/chipping green, and
        access to paved bike trails that lead to downtown Seattle. Explore the Northwest then come home
        to a greenbelt haven. We do fill up in summer, so please book your site early. We welcome all rigs
         - big or small.</p>

          <p>I can not express enough how wonderful this place is!! They go out of their way to make you feel like part of the family !! Toni went above and beyond to help us out and even gave us some tips and what to do when the unexpected snow hit us! Thank you soooo sooo much for always having a smile a wave and for making us feel right at home in your beautiful park!! The park is immaculate the showers and laundry room are so well kept you'd swear it's all brand new. I really hate to leave and I wish I could just take the whole place with us. Until we meet again!! Love, The Kilbourns</p>

        <p>If you're thinking about staying at lake pleasant,  stop thinking and do. It is a wonderful atmosphere all around. You're in the middle of a city and would never guess it with the quiet and the scenery. The staff are incredibly helpful and caring, and Toni and Laura will bend the natural laws of physics to help you and make your stay as enjoyable as can be whatever your reason for being there. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it, from the beautiful lake and the gorgeous walking trails, to the convenience and awe inspiringly dedicated staff. My wife and I are sad to leave, and will be back as often as we can even of it's just for a cup of coffee and a cookie. Thank you for such a wonderful time and lovely experience.

          <p>This is one of the BEST RV parks in western Washington!! It is beautifully surrounded by evergreens and has a many hiking trails for our pups to explore. There are geese and ducks everywhere! We were lucky enough to back up to the lake and we really enjoyed the view. The friendly management and staff went out of their way to make sure we felt welcomed. The laundry room was well equipped and only cost $1.00 per wash or dry. There is a grocery store across the street as well as many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again!! Thank you for a wonderful month!!</p>
